# Chapter 01: Introduction to the Web


## Internet

The internet is an international network of connected computers. No company owns the internet; it is a cooperative effort governed by a system of standards and rules. The purpose of connecting computers together, of course, is to share information. There are many ways information can be
passed between computers, including email (POP3/IMAP/SMTP), file transfer (FTP), secure shell (SSH), and many more specialized modes upon which the internet is built. These standardized methods for transferring data or documents over a network are known as protocols.


## Web

The web (originally called the World Wide Web, thus the “www” in site addresses) is just one of the ways information can be shared over the internet. It is unique in that it allows documents to be linked to one another via hypertext links—thus forming a huge “web” of connected information. The web uses a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). That acronym should look familiar because it is the first four letters of nearly all website addresses, as we’ll discuss in an upcoming section.

### A Brief History of the Web

The web was born in a particle physics laboratory (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1989. There a computer specialist named Tim Berners-Lee first proposed a system of information management that used a “hypertext” process to link related documents over a network. He and his partner, Robert Cailliau, created a prototype and released it for review. For the first several years, web pages were text-only. It’s difficult to believe that in 1992, the world had only about 50 web servers, total. The real boost to the web’s popularity came in 1992 when the first graphical browser (NCSA Mosaic) was introduced, and the web broke out of the realm of scientific research into mass media. The ongoing development of web technologies is overseen by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
